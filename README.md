# Autonomous Backseat Driver
Generative AI can play an important role in any autonomous vehicle that operates in the open world, 
as a visual component that offers high-level commonsense directives to the vehicle, with the ability to offer explanations to the human operator of the vehicle.

This write-up is about the following topics:
* A live demo named [Autonomouse Backseat Driver](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-UpQkvuX7j-artistic-transformer) is made available through OpenAI's GPTs Store.
There a user can upload photo of a road scene, and the GPT will then return high-level driving directions along with the reasons for the suggestion.
* The information below also serves as the guide for the users of the said demo.
* Additional information are provided to people interested in pursuing this topic,
regarding how to select edge-case road scenes to test out OpenAI's GPT-4V model.
We also welcome people to test the data on other multi-modal LLMs.

## Background
As of December 2023, both the Google Gemini and OpenAI GPT-4V are multimodal, meaning that they are capable of extracting meaningful textual information from a given image. When compared the typical CNN-based vision system, 

We named such a component an **Autonomous Backseat Driver**, because we expect this component to offer only higher-level advices to the vehicle, while leaving the low-level controls to other components. This is needed because autonoumous navigation in most cases must operate in an open environment with endless unexpected conditions, and a vision component that is trained narrowly on very specific categories won't have the commonsense to deal with complex situations.

Fortunately for us, the latest multimodal large language models have shown great promise in achieve zero-shot-learning visual recognition for road conditions, and often are able to offer good advice with commonsense, along with an explanation for the given advice.

## Live Demo
You can try for yourself with an **Autonomous Backseat Driver** that we implemented using an OpenAI Custom GPT

What you could do with this Custom GPT:

- You proceed to find a suitable photo that shows a road scene from a driver's view
- Go to our Custom GPT, and upload the photo
- The Custom GPT will then return with a decision on whether the vehicle should proceed normally, slow down, stop, or turn around. An explanation for the decision will also be given. 

## Examples

Following are some examples, collected here to demonstrate a number of points:

* There are endless situation on the open road that need to be handled well by any autonomous vehicle.
* There are many confusing situations that require some level of commonsense reasoning in order to reach good decision.
* Important decisions should be explained.

Note that the emphasis in the responses below are mine.

### Example: Monster ahead
![monster ahead](images/monster2.jpg)
- **Notes**: extremely unusual scene. Testing sense of reality.
- **Response from OpenAI GPT-4**: This image appears to be a **fictional or altered scene**, as it shows a giant creature resembling a dinosaur in an urban setting, which does not exist in reality. In the context of the scenario you've asked me to provide advice on, **if this were a real situation**, it would constitute an extreme hazard.

    The recommended action would be to immediately stop the vehicle at a safe distance, and reverse or turn around if possible to evacuate the area. Contacting emergency services would be crucial...</td>

### Example: explosion ahead
![explosion ahead](images/nuclear.jpg)
- Notes: testing recognition of exceptional event
- Response from OpenAI GPT-4: This image depicts a large explosion in the form of a mushroom cloud, resembling a nuclear explosion, at the end of a long road.

    If this were a real situation, it would represent an extremely serious and life-threatening hazard. The appropriate response would be:

    - Immediate Evacuation: Do not drive towards the explosion. Turn around and drive away from the blast area as quickly as possible.
    - Seek Information: Tune into local radio or emergency services channels if possible to get information about what has happened and where to go.
    - Avoid Exposure: If you are within range of potential fallout, seek shelter immediately. This would typically be an underground area or a building made of thick, dense materials. Stay indoors, seal windows and doors, and wait for instructions from emergency services.
    - Protective Measures: If exposed to fallout, cover your mouth and nose with a mask or cloth to reduce inhalation of radioactive particles.
    - Contact Emergency Services: Once at a safe distance or in shelter, contact emergency services for further instructions.

    It is important to note that this response would be appropriate for a real nuclear event. However, the image provided is likely not a real scenario but a digital creation or a photo from a controlled test or movie scene. If you are ever unsure about whether a situation like this is real, it's crucial to seek information from reliable sources and follow official guidance.

### Example: tornado ahead
![tornado ahead](images/tornadoes.jpg)
- Notes: unusual and extremely dangerous. Testing scenario never trained for, and commonsense reaction. 
- Response from OpenAI GPT-4: The image depicts a large tornado directly in the path of the road. Tornadoes are extremely dangerous and can cause catastrophic damage to vehicles, buildings, and the environment, as well as serious injury or loss of life.

    The immediate recommendation is to not proceed. Turn the vehicle around and drive away from the tornado at a right angle to its apparent path to seek immediate shelter. If you cannot quickly drive to a safe location, it's advised to exit the vehicle and find a low-lying area, such as a ditch, to lie down in, covering your head with your arms to protect yourself from flying debris and high winds. Do not seek shelter under overpasses or bridges, as these can create dangerous wind channels.

    It's also important to listen to weather alerts and have a plan for seeking shelter in case of severe weather like this. If you're in a region prone to tornadoes, keeping an emergency kit in your vehicle, including a first aid kit, water, food, and a portable weather radio, is advisable.

### Example: tornado on a commercial billboard 
![downed trees](images/tornado_fake.png)
- Notes: test distinction between real hazard and fictitious ones.
- Response from OpenAI GPT-4: The image shows a billboard advertising a place called "Naderville," which seems to be a reference to tornadoes, as indicated by the term 'nader, a colloquialism for "tornado." The billboard advertises "â€˜Nader Kits, Shelters and more," suggesting it is a business that sells emergency supplies and shelters for tornado protection.

    While the billboard itself does not present a direct hazard to drivers, it does serve as a reminder that the area is prone to tornadoes and that drivers should be prepared for such events. It's important for individuals in such regions to be aware of the weather conditions and have a plan for seeking shelter in case of a tornado warning.

    There are no actions required for the driver in relation to this billboard, but it would be wise to stay informed about the weather when driving in regions where tornadoes are common.

### Example: tornado warning sign
![](images/billboard_tornado.jpeg)
- Notes: testing recognition of non-standard warning sign, and recognition that this it is not a commercial
- Response from OpenAI GPT-4: The image shows a digital road sign with a message that reads "TORNADO WARNING FOR THIS AREA." A tornado warning indicates that a tornado has been sighted or indicated by weather radar, and there is an imminent danger to life and property.

    Here are the plausible serious hazards and recommended actions:

    - Immediate Tornado Threat: The warning suggests that a tornado may be very close. The hazard is the potential for the tornado to cross or impact the roadway, posing life-threatening danger to anyone outside of a secure shelter.
    - Debris: Tornadoes can carry debris which may be deposited on or near the roadway, creating driving hazards even if the tornado is not directly crossing the road.
    - Traffic: The warning may cause sudden or erratic driving behavior as people attempt to seek shelter, which can result in vehicular accidents.

    Recommendations:
    - If possible, exit the roadway and seek immediate shelter in a sturdy building, preferably in a basement or an interior room on the lowest floor with no windows.
    - Avoid seeking shelter under bridges or overpasses, as they do not provide protection from tornadoes and can create traffic hazards.
    - If there is no available shelter, a last-resort option is to park the car safely away from traffic lanes and lie flat in a low area covering your head and neck with your arms.
    - Keep a tornado survival kit in your vehicle, which includes items like a first aid kit, water, non-perishable food, a flashlight, and a portable weather radio.

    It's crucial to take immediate action upon seeing this sign and not to continue driving as if conditions are normal.

### Example: false positive tornado image
![false positive tornado](images/tornadoes_test1.png)
- Notes: test distinction between real warning signs, and commercials that should be ignored
- Response from OpenAI GPT-4: The image shows a billboard with a graphic that includes a tornado, which might be associated with a sports team or event in Kansas City. The content of the billboard does not indicate a real tornado threat or weather warning; it appears to be a form of advertisement or branding, perhaps for a sports team named the "Tornadoes."

    In this context, there are no immediate driving hazards present related to weather. However, as always, when driving:

    - Pay attention to the road and your surroundings, not the billboard.
    - Be mindful of other vehicles and pedestrians.
    - Follow all traffic signals and road signs.
    - Stay aware of weather conditions through reliable sources, especially if you are in an area prone to severe weather.

    It's important to differentiate between actual weather warnings and advertisements or symbols used in marketing. For real-time weather updates, one should rely on official weather channels, radio announcements, or mobile weather alerts.

### Example: pedestrian in the dark
![pedestrian in the dark](images/nightcrosswalk2.jpg)
- Notes: test recognition of pedestrians in low light
- Response from OpenAI GPT-4: The image shows a pedestrian crossing the street at a crosswalk at night. Here are the potential hazards and the recommended action:

    Hazards:
  
    - Pedestrian in the Roadway: The person crossing the street is the primary concern. At night, visibility is reduced, and the pedestrian might not be easily seen by drivers.
    - Low Light Conditions: Given that it is nighttime, there may be a reduced ability for drivers to see and react to road conditions and pedestrians.

    Recommendations:

    - Reduce Speed: Slow down when approaching crosswalks, especially in low light conditions.
    - Yield to Pedestrians: Be prepared to stop if necessary to allow the pedestrian to cross safely.
    - Stay Vigilant: Keep an eye out for other pedestrians who may also be trying to cross the street, as there could be more people outside the field of view of this image.
    - Use Headlights: Make sure your vehicle's headlights are on and properly adjusted to ensure maximum visibility without blinding other road users.
  
### Example: downed trees
![downed trees](images/downed-trees.jpg)
- Notes: severe road hazard
- Response from OpenAI GPT-4: In the image, there are several serious hazards present:

    Fallen Tree: A large tree has fallen across the road, completely blocking passage. This poses a direct physical barrier to vehicles.

    Downed Power Lines: The fallen tree has brought down power lines, which are potentially live and represent a significant electrocution risk.

    Road Debris: Smaller branches and debris from the tree are scattered across the road, posing additional risks for tire damage and vehicle stability.

    The recommended action is to stop the vehicle at a safe distance from the fallen tree and downed power lines. Do not attempt to drive over or around the debris. Turning around and finding an alternate route would be the safest course of action. Additionally, it's crucial to alert the local authorities to the fallen tree and downed power lines so that they can safely clear the road and repair any damage. It's also important to warn other drivers of the hazard if possible.

### Example: complex sign with social warnings
![smash and grab](images/smash_and_grab.jpg)
- Notes: this is not directly related the control of a vehicle, but it serves to test whether the system is able to recognize cues in a potentially dangerous environment. 
- Response from OpenAI GPT-4: The image shows a safety alert sign warning of a "Smash and Grab" hotspot, which indicates a high incidence of theft from vehicles in the area. Here are the hazards and recommendations:

    Hazards:
  
    - Risk of theft from vehicles, potentially leading to loss of valuables and damage to the vehicle.
    - Possible vehicle break-in, which could involve window smashing and the associated cost and inconvenience of repairs.
    - Personal safety may be at risk if encountering thieves in the act.

    Recommendations:

    - Take all electronics, purses, bags, and valuables with you when leaving your vehicle.
    - Leave nothing of value visible inside the vehicle to deter potential theft.
    - If you must leave items in the vehicle, ensure they are well hidden from view.
    - Be vigilant and report any suspicious activity to the US Park Police using the provided contact number.

    Remember: taking proactive steps to secure your belongings can significantly reduce the risk of theft.

### Example: road closed
![road closed](images/blocked_road.jpeg)
- Notes: testing inpassable driving condition
- Response from OpenAI GPT-4: The image shows a clear hazard: the road is closed, indicated by multiple signs and barriers. Here's the appropriate action based on this scene:

    - Do Not Proceed: The "ROAD CLOSED" signs are unmistakable indicators that the road ahead is not safe or permissible for travel. You should not attempt to go around or move the barriers.
    - Turn Around Safely: Find a safe place to turn around and seek an alternate route. Use a GPS or a map to find another way to your destination.
    - Inform Authorities (if applicable): If you happen to be the first to encounter this without prior warning, it might be helpful to report the road closure to local authorities, especially if it seems like an immediate or unexpected hazard.

    The closure could be due to various reasons such as road work, an accident, or a natural disaster. It's important to respect these closures for your own safety and to remain within the law.

### Example: lane closure
![lane closure](images/traffice_cones.jpg)
- Notes: test road condition that requires caution. GPT-4 seems to recognize the **wrong lane** as closed.
- Response from OpenAI GPT-4: In this image, we see a road maintenance operation underway, with the **right lane** closed off by traffic cones and maintenance vehicles present.

    Hazards:
    - Lane Closure: The right lane is closed, necessitating a merge into the open lane to continue safely.
    - Maintenance Vehicles and Workers: Presence of road work crew and vehicles poses a risk if not navigated cautiously.
    Recommendations:
    - Merge Safely: Signal early and merge into the open lane as soon as possible before reaching the lane closure.
    - Reduce Speed: Follow any posted speed limit reductions and be prepared to stop if necessary.
    - Stay Alert: Watch for any workers who may be near the traffic lanes and for sudden movements of maintenance vehicles.
    - Maintain a Safe Distance: Keep a safe following distance from the vehicle in front of you, as well as from the maintenance vehicles and workers.
    
    Road work can create unpredictable driving conditions, so it is important to remain vigilant and drive defensively through the work zone.

### Example: too many signs
![messy signs](images/many_signs.png)
- Notes: test ability to read complex signs and reason with it
- Response from OpenAI GPT-4: The image shows a complex array of parking signs with various restrictions:

    - No Parking from 11 AM to 1 PM on Tuesdays for street cleaning.
    - Tow-away zone with no stopping on school days from Monday to Friday between 7:30 AM and 4 PM.
    - 15-minute parking for school business on school days from Monday to Friday between 7:30 AM and 8 AM.
    - 1-hour parking on school days from Monday to Friday between 4 PM and 6 PM.
    - Vehicles with district permits are exempt from these restrictions.

    The layered restrictions indicate that parking regulations change throughout the day and week, likely to accommodate school traffic and street cleaning schedules. These signs require careful attention to ensure you're not parked illegally at any time, which could result in fines or your vehicle being towed.

    If you're driving in this area, you need to be aware of these restrictions and plan accordingly, especially if you intend to park. Always double-check the current time, the day of the week, and whether school is in session to comply with the regulations. If in doubt, find an alternative place to park where the rules are less restrictive and clearer.
- Follow-up Q&A:
    - Q: User
it is 2pm Saturday right now, can I park here?
    - A: Based on the information provided in the image and the fact that it is 2 PM on a Saturday, none of the restrictions mentioned on the signs apply:

        - The "No Parking" is only for Tuesday from 11 AM to 1 PM.
        - The "No Stopping" and parking time limits apply on school days (Monday through Friday).

        Therefore, you should be able to park at this location at 2 PM on a Saturday without violating the restrictions shown. However, always be sure to observe any other possible restrictions that may not be visible in the image or any temporary restrictions that may be in place.
      
### Example: standing water or sink hole?
![standing water](images/oil_slick.jpeg)
- Notes: somehow GPT-4 sees the hazard as a sinkhole, instead of either standing water or oil slick. When asked to list all possible explanations, then standing water is listed as one possibility. This is a case that warrant further study.
- Response from OpenAI GPT-4: In this image, we see a road that has been severely compromised by a sinkhole, which is a significant road hazard. Here's how to address this situation:

    - Stop the Vehicle: Immediately reduce your speed and come to a stop at a safe distance from the sinkhole.
    - Do Not Attempt to Cross: The sinkhole presents a clear danger, and attempting to cross could result in vehicle damage or a life-threatening situation if the road were to collapse further.
    - Turn Around Safely: Once stopped and it's safe to do so, carefully turn the vehicle around and find an alternate route.
    - Report the Hazard: Inform the local authorities about the road hazard so that they can take appropriate actions to repair the road and set up warnings for other drivers.
    - Alert Other Drivers: If you have a way to warn other drivers, such as hazard lights or if you can place warning devices at a safe distance before the hazard, do so to prevent others from approaching the danger.
